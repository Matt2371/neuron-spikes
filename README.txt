In this project, we use a subset of data from Steinmetz et al. (2019) to study how brain activity, specifically neuron firings, are associated with the process of being shown visual stimuli and performing as simple task. In the original study, mice were shown different contrast levels on either side and performed a simple task in response, with their brain activity recorded during the process.

Overall, we:
1. Group neurons by their firing behavior using k-means
2. Analyze how firings rates correspond to both stimuli including their interaction using ANOVA.
3. Predict the success of the tasks using random forest and logistic regression.

The full analysis is documented in Final_report.Rmd.
